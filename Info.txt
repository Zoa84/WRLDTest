Originally worked on what is now the FindTotalDistance branch in Github, thinking the problem was to find the feature which was the largest total distance from other features. After doing that and getting the wrong answer, I figured out the actual problem was to find the longest, shortest distance from a feature to other features, so finding the shortest distance from a feature to other features, and comparing this to all the shortest distance for all other features, and selecting the one with the longest distance.
