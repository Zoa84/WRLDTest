Originally worked on what is now the FindTotalDistance branch in Github, thinking the problem was to find the feature which was the largest total distance from other features. After doing that and getting the wrong answer, I figured out the actual problem was to find the longest, shortest distance from a feature to other features, so finding the shortest distance from a feature to other features, and comparing this to all the shortest distance for all other features, and selecting the one with the longest distance.

Instructions:
1. Open WRLDTest.sln in Visual Studio

2. If the WRLDTest.cpp file is not open, in the Solution Explorer on the right, open the WRLDTest project, open Source Files, and double click the .cpp file

3. If you wish to have debug text (mainly used for testing and checking each part runs correctly) you can change the bDebugText variable from false to true

4. If not set, change the Solution Configuration from Debug to Release to run the program faster (Left of the Local Windows Debugger button)

5. Click Local Windows Debugger to run the program

6. Enter the file path to the problems:
..\..\WRLD_programming_test\problem_small.txt
..\..\WRLD_programming_test\problem_big.txt
